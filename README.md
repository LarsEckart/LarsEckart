### Hi there, I'm [Lars!](https://larseckart.com/) 👋

##### Technical Coach @ Rush Street Interactive • Trainer • Speaker

I am an experienced java developer, originally from Germany and living in Estonia since 2013. I enjoy test-driven development, pair programming and improving legacy code.

## 🌐 Current work 

I am working for [Rush Street Interactive](https://rushstreetinteractive.com/), helping development teams to do their jobs better.
      
## 🌎 Open source contributions
      
I’am contributing to the java version of [Approvaltests](https://approvaltests.com/). Occassionally I also contribute to [cyber-dojo](https://cyber-dojo.org/), updating the java images to use the latest JDK and versions of JUnit5&Approvaltests.
      
## 🗣️ Speaking I’ve done
      
Since I've become one of the co-organisers of Tartu Software Developer Guild, I've also done some public speaking outside of my work environment. I spoke about the new features of Java 11 when it released and in February 2020 about Approval testing.
